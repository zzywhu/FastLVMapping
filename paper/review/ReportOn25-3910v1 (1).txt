This paper introduces EasyColor, a method for colorizing dense LiDAR
point clouds from image sequences without precise time synchronization
or extrinsic calibration. It uses LiDAR reflectivity to generate
intensity images, aligns them with RGB frames via cross-domain
matching, and refines camera poses through joint optimization based on
frame consistency and epipolar geometry. 

Overall, the paper is well-written, well-structured, and
well-illustrated. It addresses a relevant theme for the RA-L community.
However, several key 
Aspects require more clarification (please see the review reports from
reviewers 1 and 2). The work would benefit from more convincing
experimental support using well-established datasets and benchmarks.
Moreover, the proposed method should be compared to the state of the
art. The evaluation protocol and metrics should also be clarified. 

Three reviewers with prior experience in computer vision and perception
evaluated the manuscript. The reviewers’ comments and recommendations
are attached. Based on the reviewers’ feedback (reviewer 3 is not taken
into account because their evaluation is not substantial) and my own
review, I suggest that the paper cannot be accepted for publication in
RA-L.
